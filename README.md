## Fudge These Files To Fit Template

A browser-based tool to do multi-regex transformation of multiple HTML input files and embed them into a template with live preview of the results.

Yes, I know that regex is not really the "right" tool to transform HTML, but it's sometimes good for a quick-and-dirty fix when you have a stack of files that need the same adaptations.

This software is Alpha. Bugs are inevitable. Gentle feedback welcome.
